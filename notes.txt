What this app does:

Thread length calculator for calculatiing needed amount of Thread

Values taken: 

Total length of stitching (How long the side of what you want to stitch is) (mm)
Hole count
Stitch size in SPI (mm in brackets) 
    5 - 5.2mm
    6 - 4.3mm
    7 - 3.85mm
    8 - 3.38mm
    9 - 3mm
    10 - 2.7mm
    11 - 2.45mm
    12 - 2.3mm
Thickness of item to be stiched (mm)
Length of Finishing thread (/How much you want leftover to work with)


Two buttons 

Calculate based on Length
Calculate based on hole count

Output of total thread length needed in mm

Total length of stitching or hole count - only one is needed. If both are filled in then it will use the calculation depending on which button is pressed.

There is another output of either number of holes or length of stitching

If calculate based on length is used then it will display number of holes
If calculate based on Hole Count is used, then it will display the length of stitching

Calculations: 

Based on length: 

Stitch length = Total length of stitch line * 2
Hole count = Total length of stitch line / stitch size(mm)
InternalLength = Hole count /* Thickness
Finishing = length of finishing * 2

100
100/3.85 = 26
3 * 26 = 78
100

Double all = 200+200+156 > correct

Based on hole count 

Stitch length = hole count * stitch size 
internal = hole count * Thickness
Finishing = finishing

26*3.85 = 100
26*3 = 78
100

278*2 > correct
